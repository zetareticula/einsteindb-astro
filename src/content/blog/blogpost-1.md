## EinsteinDB - Relativistic Linearizable Database
EinsteinDB is a cutting-edge, relativistic linearizable database that revolutionizes data storage and retrieval. Built with Rust and go, it combines the power of distributed systems with the simplicity of a single-node FoundationDB database.

Key Features:
- Relativistic consistency: EinsteinDB ensures linearizability, providing strong consistency guarantees even in the presence of network partitions and failures.
- High performance: With its optimized data structures and algorithms, EinsteinDB delivers exceptional read and write performance, making it suitable for high-throughput applications.
- Scalability: EinsteinDB is designed to scale horizontally, allowing you to seamlessly add more nodes to handle increasing workloads.
- Fault tolerance: The database is fault-tolerant, automatically recovering from failures and maintaining data integrity.

Whether you're building a real-time analytics platform, a high-traffic web application, or a distributed system, EinsteinDB is the perfect choice for your data storage needs.

To get started with EinsteinDB, simply install the package using npm:
